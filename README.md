# Rock Paper Scissors
Personal project based on The Odin Project's Full Stack path.

This is a simple rock, paper and scissors game created with html, css and javascript. No frameworks.

First step was creating the javascript logic and use `console.log` to show the results. Second and final step was creating a proper user interface using DOM and document manipulation methods.

Hope you enjoy it.
